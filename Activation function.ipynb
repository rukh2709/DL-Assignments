    "Answer 3: Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearities, enabling neural networks to learn and model complex relationships in data. Without activation functions, neural networks would only be able to represent linear functions, severely limiting their learning capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient propagation: Activation functions determine the gradients that flow through the network during backpropagation, influencing how the network learns. A well-chosen activation function with a suitable derivative can help mitigate the vanishing or exploding gradient problems, allowing for more stable and efficient training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressiveness: Different activation functions have different expressive capabilities. Some activation functions like ReLU can capture sparse and selective activations, which is beneficial for handling large-scale datasets and complex patterns. Others like sigmoid and tanh provide smooth transitions, often useful for ensuring smoothness and normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output range: Activation functions define the range of values that a neuron's output can take. This range can impact the behavior of subsequent layers and the final predictions. For example, sigmoid and softmax activation functions constrain outputs to specific ranges (0 to 1 or probabilities), making them suitable for binary or multi-class classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational efficiency: Activation functions can also affect the computational efficiency of the network. Certain activation functions, such as ReLU, have computationally inexpensive operations compared to others like sigmoid or tanh, leading to faster training and inference times."

    "\n",
    "Avoiding vanishing gradients: The ReLU activation function helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. In deep neural networks, the gradients can become extremely small when using the sigmoid function, making it difficult for the network to learn. ReLU provides a constant gradient of 1 for positive inputs, allowing for more effective gradient propagation and learning in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity and efficiency: ReLU can induce sparsity in neural networks by zeroing out negative inputs, resulting in sparse activations. This sparsity can be beneficial in reducing the computational load during training and inference, as zero activations do not contribute to the overall computation.\n",

    "Improved convergence speed: ReLU activation has been observed to facilitate faster convergence during training compared to sigmoid. The linear nature of ReLU simplifies the optimization landscape and allows for more efficient learning.\n",

ReLU, on the other hand, does not suffer from saturation, enabling better representation of highly varying and large-scale data.\n",

    "In standard ReLU, any negative input is mapped to zero, effectively \"turning off\" the neuron. However, this can lead to the neuron's gradient being zero, causing the weights associated with that neuron to stop updating during backpropagation and resulting in a dead neuron that does not contribute to learning.\n",

    "Leaky ReLU solves this issue by introducing a small slope for negative inputs. Instead of mapping negative inputs to zero, leaky ReLU maps them to a small negative value, typically a fraction of the input, such as 0.01 times the input. Mathematically, the leaky ReLU function is defined as:\n",
